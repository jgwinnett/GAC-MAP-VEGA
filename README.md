Stochiastic Block Model visualization example using:

* GAC-MAP (GTR & Cordis Mapping) - another project I wrote, data scraping and processing academic databases in order to estimate how active UK institutions were in researching mobile 5G.
  * The codebase for this has... vanished. [I am confusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7X7cEh5au8).
  * Documentation for a tool that no longer exists - https://gac-map.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
  * It was a data focused Python project making heavy us of [Graph Tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/), pandas and numpy.
  
* [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) - a visualization grammar. I opted to use this as it was simpler for me to learn & automate for. I would have used D3 if I had the time to learn Javascript.
